## Skill Exchange Platform- Project 12

This project is a web platform designed to facilitate the learning of skills through a mutual exchange between users. Users can register to teach one skill and learn another, creating a collaborative learning community. The interface was created with React and complies with advanced use of hooks and optimizations for optimal performance.

## Functionalities

Users can register on the platform through the registration form, which allows them to access additional functionalities. Once registered, they can:
Add interesting users to their favorites list for easy follow-up and connection with them.
View the hourly availability of users who offer learning skills.

Without registering, users will have limited access and will only be able to see the general list of users who are offering or looking to learn a skill.

Current status of the project: The login forms and the home page component are under construction and will be integrated soon in another project.
